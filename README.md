# Multithreading Learning Repository

This repository serves as a learning resource for multithreading concepts in C++. It covers various topics including mutex, lock guards, futures and promises, asyncs, and conditional variables.

## Topics Covered

- Mutex: Synchronization primitive used to protect shared data from simultaneous access by multiple threads.
- Lock Guards: RAII-based synchronization mechanism that automatically locks and unlocks a mutex.
- Futures and Promises: Mechanism for asynchronously retrieving the result of a computation performed in another thread.
- Asyncs: Function template for launching asynchronous tasks.
- Conditional Variables: Synchronization primitive used to block and unblock threads based on specified conditions.
